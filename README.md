  local colour_month = "#44AAFF"     -- Month name
  local colour_weekdays = "#CCCCCC" -- Weekday headers
  local colour_days = "#FFFFFF"     -- Normal days
  local colour_today = "#00FF00"    -- Today's date
  local colour_outside = "#555555"  -- Days outside the current month
  local colour_weeknums = "#44AAFF" -- Week numbers
  ```
